					<h1>Overview</h1>
					<p>Every year engineering physics students are challenged to make robots to compete in the ENPH 253 robotics competition. This years competition was to locate and retrieve stuffed animals from the competition surface. The robots used multiple sensing systems to navigate along the course. Once pets were located the robot would retrieve them and attempt to carry them back to safety before the wall of fire blocked its path.</p>
					<p>Members of Rescue One (Alexander Goddijn, Bryden Fogelman, Stefan Sander-Green, and Arjun Venkatesh) designed a robot, H.A.L.P., for the competition. H.A.L.P., along with 15 other robots, was built in 5 weeks.</p>
					<p>On competition day H.A.L.P. won both of its qualification rounds scoring eight out of nine possible points on both runs. Before finals got underway a software problem that was stopping H.A.L.P. from retrieving the final pet was fixed. H.A.L.P. won its quarterfinal match scoring all nine points. In the semi final H.A.L.P. and Botbot both scored eight, but Botbot advanced on time and went on going on to win the competition. In the third place match H.A.L.P. once again won by scoring nine points.</p>
					<p>This course was a challenging and rewarding learning opportunity for all members of Rescue One. We gained experience in Electrical, Mechanical and Software design as well as prototyping skills including: using Solidworks, using a waterjet cutter, using a laser cutter, soldering  and using hand tools.</p>

					<h4>Overview</h4>
					<p>H.A.L.P. is powered by a 16v Lithium-Polymer Battery. Signal processing and I/O is done using the TINAH microcontroller (similar to Arduino). In addition electrical circuits are used to for sensory input and for motor output.</p>
					
					<h4>Motor driving circuits</h4>
					<p>Pulse Width Modulation control is supplied to the motors by H-Bridge circuits. </p>
					<h4>IR sensing</h4>
					
					<p>A 10kHz infrared beacon indicated the position of the final pet. QSD124 phototransistors were used to detect the signal. An analog signal processing circuit determined the strength of the IR signal and thus position relative to the beacon.</p>

					<h4>Drivetrain</h4> 
					<p>H.A.L.P. is driven and steered differentially by two geared Barber-Colman motors. The drive gear (attached to the motor shaft) is made out of Delrin: a durable low friction plastic, while the wheel gear is made out of acrylic. The wheels used are rubber rollerblade wheels and provide fantastic grip on the painted plywood surface. A 4:1 gear ratio allows the robot to move swiftly while ensuring enough torque is fed to the wheels to climb up the playing surface ramp. </p>

					<h4>Chassis</h4>
					<p> 1/4 inch lasercut plywood was used for the chassis because it is lightweight, durable and allows the use of wood screws for easy fastening and unfastening of components. All brackets were either 3D printed using ABS plastic or waterjet and bent out of lightweight aluminum sheet metal. </p>

					<h4>Main Arm</h4>
					<p>The main pet pickup arm uses a spool system to raise and lower the arm with a geared motor to control the base movement of the arm. Arm positions are measured using potentiometers located at the pivot and base of the arm.</p>

					<!-- Closeup of the arm’s base and spool. (armBase2.png) -->

					<p>Pickup/Release Plate uses a steel top plate (magnetic) to pick up the pets and an aluminum (non-magnetic) bottom plate to release the pets. A microswitch located on the top plate detects if the plates are pressed together and indicates that a pet has been picked up. The servo turns the cam to separate the two plates and release the pet. </p>
